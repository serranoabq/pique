== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Pique includes support for Infinite Scroll, Site Logo, and Testimonials in Jetpack (jetpack.com).

= How do I set up my front page? =

When you first activate Pique, your homepage will display posts in a traditional blog format. To set up your one-page template as the homepage, follow these steps:

* Create a page.
* Go to Settings → Reading and set "Front page displays" to "A static page."
* Select the page created in Step One as “Front page,” and choose another page as “Posts page” to display your blog posts.

Good news! This theme doesn't need a front-page template—just set a static page as your front page, and you're good to go. On its own, it displays a single panel with a full-screen featured image, your site logo and navigation, and your page content.

To get your one-page site set up, you'll want to add some more panels.

= How do I add more panels to the front page? =

Each "panel" is a page. To add additional panels to your Front Page, follow these steps:

* Create or edit a page.
* Navigate to Customize → Theme Options. From the drop-down, select the page you'd like to appear in the panel.

= How do I set the background image of my panels? =

To set the background image of a panel, assign a Featured Image to the page. You can also adjust the background color and the opacity of your featured image on top of it, allowing you fine-grained control over the appearance of your page.

The footer widget uses your Custom Header Image as its background.

= Does this theme come with page templates? =

Pique comes with three page templates, designed to give you flexibility in the way you arrange your content. To use a page template, edit your page and select the template you'd like under Page Attributes.

* Grid Template
* Full-Width Template
* Testimonials Template

You can also show a panel of the four most recent blog posts by adding the page you selected as your “Posts page” as a panel in the Customizer.

= How do I use icons? =

Pique comes packaged with the Font Awesome icon library so that you have easy access to hundreds of icons. To use an icon, find the icon you're looking for on Font Awesome's website (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and copy the code provided.

= How do I use call-to-action buttons? =

You can add call-to-action buttons to your site by using the following code:
<a href="#" class="button">Learn more</a>
<a href="#" class="minimal button">Try it out</a>

= How do I add an overlay? =

Sometimes, you may want to show a smaller area of content with a solid background. This is especially useful if you'd like to show a map in the background, with your content information overlaid on top. This works particularly nicely when combined with a Full-Width Template.

<div class="overlay alignright">This overlay will be aligned to the right-hand side of its panel. You can add any content you'd like here.</div>

= How do I add my logo? =

Site logo functionality requires the Jetpack plugin.
To add your logo, go to Customize → Site Title. Your logo will appear above the site navigation on every page.

= Where can I add menus? =

Pique allows you to have two meus: one in the theme’s header and one in the footer. To set up your menus, go to Appearance → Menus.

* Primary Menu *
The primary menu will display at the top of your page. To add links to panels of your Front Page, just add the page to your menu. The theme will handle the rest and make sure it links to the right spot!

* Dynamic Menu *
If you'd like your front page to automatically show a menu of your panels, you can do this by navigating to Customizer → Theme Options → General Settings and checking "Use a dynamically-generated menu on the front page." Pique will then automatically create a menu for the front page only that will link to each panel.

* Secondary Menu *
The secondary menu has been designed to provide quick links for your visitors. It only supports top-level links—if you have a child menu item, it won’t be displayed. This secondary menu will be displayed in the footer of your site. It's a good place to put Terms &amp; Conditions and a Privacy Policy, or quick links to important pages on your site. Alternatively, you could use this area to add your social media links.

= How do I display customer testimonials? =
Testimonial functionality requires the Jetpack plugin active on your site.

There are two ways Pique can show testimonials:

* The dedicated testimonial archive page displays all testimonials in reverse chronological order, with the newest displayed first. Your testimonial archive page can be found at http://mygroovysite.wordpress.com/testimonial/
* The Testimonials page template displays two testimonials at random. This allows you to display testimonials as a panel on your Front Page.
